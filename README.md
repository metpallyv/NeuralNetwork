# AutoEncoder NeuralNetwork
Goal of this project is implement Autoencoder Neural Network using BackPropogation Algorithm with using any Machine Learning libraries.

Nueral network is basis for Deep learning.
I am implementing neural network using back-prop algorithm using stochastic gradient descent and with "n" input units (for data with "n features), k
hidden units,one hidden layer and "n" output units. 

Future works: Need to extend this for multilayer neural network and for CNN.
